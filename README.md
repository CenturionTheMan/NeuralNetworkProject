## Introduction
The project endeavors to develop a neural network library designed for educational and experimental
objectives. Moreover, an accompanying hand-digit recognizer utilizing the MNIST dataset has been crafted
utilizing this library.

## Features
* Implementation of neural network models.
* Support for various activation functions and layers structures.
* The test application which enables users to draw custom shapes and subsequently classify them as digits using neural network.


## Using
To get started with using the neural network modules clone this 
repository and make sure to install all necessary libraries.
